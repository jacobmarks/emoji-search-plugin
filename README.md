## Emoji Search Plugin

This plugin allows you to search for emojis based on the text you input. The
operators will only appear in menus in the FiftyOne App if `emoji` is in the
dataset's name (case-insensitive).

With `pyperclip`, you can also copy an emoji to your clipboard! This is useful
if you want to paste the emoji into a text message. The option should appear in
the sample viewer menu when you enter the sample modal.

## Under the Hood

The plugin uses a two-step search process. Both steps utilize text descriptions
of the emojis, which are generated by GPT-4, and are of the form "A photo of ..."

Step 1 performs a relatively cheap pre-filtering search using precomputed CLIP
embeddings of the emoji descriptions, and an on-the-fly CLIP embedding of the
input text. This step returns 30 emojis, which are then passed to step 2.

Step 2 performs a more expensive re-ranking using a cross-encoder model from
the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which computes
a similarity score between the input text and the emoji description text
directly, rather than relying on separate embeddings. This step returns the
(at most 10) most semantically similar emojis to the input text, above a certain
threshold.

## Installation

This plugin requires `fiftyone>=0.23.0`. Upgrade your FiftyOne installation
before installing this plugin:

```shell
pip install fiftyone --upgrade
```

You can then install the plugin itself:

```shell
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/jacobmarks/emoji-search-plugin
```

You will also need to install the plugin's requirements:

```shell
fiftyone plugins requirements @jacobmarks/emoji_search --install
```

## Operators

### `search_emojis`

This operator will semantically search for emojis based on the input text. It
will return a subset of the emojis in the dataset that are most semantically
similar to the input text, above a certain threshold.

### `copy_emoji_to_clipboard`

This operator will copy the emoji to the clipboard!
